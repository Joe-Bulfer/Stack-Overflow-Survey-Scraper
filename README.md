# Stack-Overflow-Survey-Scraper
Scrapes 2012 to 2022 Stack Overflow Survey Data and Visualizes using Chart.js

As programmers we must choose the right decisions when deciding between learning one technology over another. The easiest way to predict the future and longevity of a programming language is to simply analyze it's previous popularity, market share, and rating by developers, then make predictions based off these trends. This python script will go to each Stack Overflow Survey (SOS) from 2012 to 2022 and scrape meaningful data to find trends of developer technology. 

The HTML code is the same from 2015 to 2019. Then from 2020 to 2022 they start using tables and table rows instead of divs. So I should be able to create two functions, one to scrape the date on graphs in 2015-2019, then another function to scrape 2020-2022. 

- [x] Built functions to scrape any given graph of 2013-2022

  
- [x] Scrape popularity/usage data of programming/scripting/markup languages of 2013-2022
- [ ] Convert python usage data to JSON
- [ ] Create chart.js for langauge usage of 2013-2022
